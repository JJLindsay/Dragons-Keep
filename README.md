Welcome to Dragons-Keep
===========
!!!<b>DISCLAIMER</b> - 04/01/2015 -This project is under going several <i><b>dramatic</b></i> refactorings in the coming weeks, primarily dealing with various creation design patterns: singleton, Factory, and more. A GUI and a name change is also coming soon...

Dragons Keep is a text based adventure game written for ITEC 3860, Software Development I<br/>
--This started as a course project for teams of 4 students to come up with an idea for a Java text-based game and implement it using the full SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle). Since the projects completions, I have carried on to heavily improve the code and I will continue to do so...

ENJOY :)<br/>
